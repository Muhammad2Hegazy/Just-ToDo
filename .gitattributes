# Ignore C++ and CMake files for language statistics as this is a Flutter/Dart project

# Ignore C++ source and header files
*.cpp linguist-vendored

# Ignore CMake build system files

# You can also explicitly include other files if they are being misidentified,
# though for Flutter, .dart files are usually correctly identified by default.
# For example, if you had a file named 'main' with no extension that was Dart:
# main linguist-language=Dart

# If specific native build files are detected as C++ or CMake and you want to hide them:
# (Uncomment and adjust paths if these are causing issues for you)
# android/CMakeLists.txt linguist-vendored
# ios/Classes/*.mm linguist-vendored # For Objective-C++ if it contributes to C++ count

# .gitattributes
# Ignore C++ files for language statistics as this is a Flutter/Dart project
*.cpp linguist-vendored
*.h linguist-vendored
*.hpp linguist-vendored

# You can also explicitly include other files if they are being misidentified,
# though for Flutter, .dart files are usually correctly identified by default.
# For example, if you had a file named 'main' with no extension that was Dart:
# main linguist-language=Dart

# Or, to ignore common native build/config files that might contain C++ references
# but aren't core application code:
# ios/Podfile linguist-vendored
# android/CMakeLists.txt linguist-vendored
# android/build.gradle linguist-vendored
# Note: Be careful with build files, as ignoring them might affect their display if they contain
# actual code in a language you want to show (less common for these specific examples).
